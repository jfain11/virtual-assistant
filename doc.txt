The regular expression pattern for the weather intent is as follows:

'weather': re.compile(r'.*(what(\'s| is))?\s*(the)?\s*(weather|forecast)\s*(like)?\s*(today|tonight|tomorrow)?\s*(right now|at the moment|currently)?\s*(\?)?.*', re.IGNORECASE)

Here is a breakdown of the components of the pattern:

    .* matches any character zero or more times
    (what(\'s| is))? matches "what's" or "what is" optionally
    \s* matches any whitespace character (e.g., space, tab, newline) zero or more times
    (the)? matches "the" optionally
    (weather|forecast) matches "weather" or "forecast"
    \s*(like)? matches "like" optionally
    \s*(today|tonight|tomorrow)? matches "today", "tonight", or "tomorrow" optionally
    \s*(right now|at the moment|currently)? matches "right now", "at the moment", or "currently" optionally
    \s*(\?)? matches a question mark optionally
    .* matches any character zero or more times

The re.IGNORECASE flag is used to make the pattern case-insensitive.

In summary, the weather pattern in your code matches any input string that contains any combination of the specified
words related to the weather intent, with the possibility of including additional text before or after the words.
The pattern is case-insensitive, so it will match input strings regardless of the capitalization of the letters.
