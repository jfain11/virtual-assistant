Virtual Assistant

CLASS STRUCTURE:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VirtualAssistantGUI class:

    This class would be the main driver class of your project with a GUI. It would be responsible for handling user
    input and providing output through the GUI.

    It would contain a method to initialize the GUI, which would include creating the main window, adding input and
    output widgets, and configuring event handlers for user input.

    It would also contain a run() method that starts the GUI event loop and handles user input and output through
    the GUI.

    Note that the VirtualAssistantGUI class is the main driver of the project in this structure, as it handles user
    input and output through the GUI. The other classes are responsible for specific tasks such as intent
    classification, action handling, and speech input/output. You can modify this structure as needed to fit the
    specific requirements of your project.

IntentClassifier class:

    This class would be responsible for classifying user input into different intents (e.g., weather, news,
    music, etc.).

    It would contain a method to load and process a dataset of labeled user input to train the intent
    classification model.

    It would also contain a method to classify user input into one of the pre-defined intents.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ActionHandler class:

    This class would be responsible for handling actions related to each intent.

    It would contain methods to handle specific actions for each intent (e.g., get weather information for the
    weather intent, play music for the music intent, etc.).

    It would also contain methods to handle common actions across multiple intents (e.g., search the web,
    set reminders, etc.).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TextToSpeech class:

    This class would be responsible for converting text output into speech output.
    It would contain methods to handle text-to-speech conversion using a text-to-speech engine (e.g.,
    Google Text-to-Speech, Microsoft Speech API, etc.).

    It would also contain methods to handle common tasks such as adjusting volume and selecting a voice.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SpeechToText class:

    This class would be responsible for converting speech input into text input.

    It would contain methods to handle speech-to-text conversion using a speech recognition engine
    (e.g., Google Speech-to-Text, Microsoft Speech API, etc.).

    It would also contain methods to handle common tasks such as adjusting sensitivity and selecting a language.
